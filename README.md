# Machine Learning From Scratch

This repository contains implementations of machine learning algorithms from scratch, without using any ML-specific libraries. The goal is to build a strong foundation in machine learning by understanding the core concepts and mathematics behind each algorithm.

## Learning Path

### 1. Fundamentals
- Linear Algebra Basics
- Probability and Statistics
- Data Preprocessing
- Model Evaluation Metrics

### 2. Supervised Learning
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines
- Naive Bayes
- k-Nearest Neighbors

### 3. Unsupervised Learning
- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- Gaussian Mixture Models

### 4. Neural Networks
- Perceptron
- Multi-layer Perceptron
- Backpropagation
- Activation Functions
- Optimization Techniques

### 5. Advanced Topics
- Regularization Techniques
- Ensemble Methods
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Time Series Analysis
